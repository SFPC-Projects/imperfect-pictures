memories of home

  * memories of home is an interactive archive conjured during a period of physical displacement. A travel diary for the lost. Drawing from a digital paper trail (images, recordings, screenshots, and links) the project maps fragments of memory to geographic coordinates. The map attempt to uncover orientation but reveals how images and media meant to anchor a sense of home fail to fully resolve.

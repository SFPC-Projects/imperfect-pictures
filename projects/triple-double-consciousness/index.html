            <p>In these Jacquard-woven textiles, I created a self-portrait with uncanny resonances and resemblances
                between myself and Du Bois. On one side of the diptych, I superimposed my own face into a well-known
                photograph of Du Bois at the 1900 Paris Exposition, where he first exhibited his signature data
                portraits. The title of the work—like that of the exhibition it is in—references Du Bois’s concept of
                double consciousness, the racialized sensation and unreconciled striving of looking at and measuring
                oneself through the eyes of others. Triple consciousness extends this concept even further, underscoring
                how race inevitably intersects with gender and sexuality. I’ve always been fascinated this particular
                portrait of Du Bois and how it presents Du Bois as a Black Dandy. I have written about his data
                visualizations, and feel close to him. In reproducing his image, I thought about his term double
                consciousness where Black people have this two ways of seeing them selves, and how for me as queer Black
                man, there is another layer of consciousness on top of that a kind of “triple consciousness.” To me Du
                Bois is queered by my presence, and the history of Dandies, In doubling this image and flipping
                it—thinking of Hito Steyerl’s “poor image” translated into textiles where there is both a shadow and a
                lowering of resolution, but a deepening of meaning when we are shown in mirror of each other. The Triple
                Double is a term in Basketball when a player in basketball a double digit total in three of the five
                main statistical categories. This double entendre about data point for the hyper masculine sport that I
                don’t play also is playing up this contrast between us. Historical accounts of Du Bois point of view of
                queerness are mixed. There is record of him being critical of a queer contemporary Alain Locke, but also
                rumors and hearsay about his own closet queerness.</p>

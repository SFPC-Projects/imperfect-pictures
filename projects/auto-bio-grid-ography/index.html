                In this site-specific work, I assemble African design patterns, family photographs, and grids printed
                directly onto the wall by the mechanical arm of a vertical UV inkjet printer. These elements serve as a
                set of data points for me to map textures and colors related to my lineage. A Scottish tartan pattern
                overlays an image of sacks of beans in a street market in Kampala, Uganda, nodding to my parental
                heritage. In another moment, a complex fractal called the Mandelbrot set overlaps a wedding photo of my
                parents, visualizing transitions from order to chaos. The work has grown out of my ongoing Black Grids
                project, which uses fractal geometry to complicate the grid and its formidable presence in art history,
                mathematics, design, philosophy, and other disciplines.

                This work features a mix of images from my mother and father’s photo archives from the 1950s–1990s
                including some of my Mother’s trips home to Uganda. Woven through those archives are photos I took from
                my first trip to Uganda as adult, self portraits as an a young man playing with masking, concealment,
                and experiments with my 1/2 Ugandan friend Paul Sepuya who’s collaborative practice allowed us to bridge
                our common experience as queer Black artists. These images are framed by patterns based on my research
                into the Hima tribe in referenced in the research of Louise E. Jefferson, that were generating using the
                open-sources software processing.

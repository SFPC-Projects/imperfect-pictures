        "description": "SPECTER evokes both the vividness and the chaos of the mind's eye. the restless arrangement of images engulfs you: photographs, ai-generated imagery, and glitchy fragments phase into each other and refuse to fully resolve. nothing unfolds in order. you encounter moments the way you might remember them—out of sequence and perhaps half-fiction, yet charged with feeling. between flashes of dread and sudden tenderness, its fractured narrative is told through the images and their metatext as if through a stream of consciousness. this is a space where feeling lingers longer than fact."

        "description": "This interactive work is built from a USB archive of images taken between roughly 2004 and 2010 — early digital photographs that were never meant to be preserved as history. They are fragments of an uncurated life. The system organizes them through the logic of compost.\n\nBrown Matter forms the base layer. These are structural, quiet images: spatial, textural, often incidental. They resist attention and break down slowly, creating atmosphere and ground. Green Matter carries emotional charge. Selfies, portraits, and social moments from adolescence surface and dissolve more quickly. They are vivid, nitrogen-rich, and unstable — images where identity was being performed and recorded at the same time. Cultural Spores drift through the field. Interface fragments, pop ephemera, and traces of early social media introduce the atmosphere of a specific era. They ferment the archive from within. Strange Growths appear intermittently: glitches, distortions, and anomalies that interrupt coherence and spread unpredictably.\n\nAs the cursor moves, digital spores activate and disturb the image field. Fragments emerge, overlap, fade, and degrade. Categories collapse into one another. Digital Compost Heap considers archival decay not as loss, but as transformation. Early digital memory, once stored as if permanent, becomes unstable material. Images soften, bleed, and erode. The archive is rotting."

Since 2022 I've maintained a consistent daily practice of journaling, often being a dumping ground for my ruminations, therapy revelations, feral crashouts, and mundane todo lists. By glitterfy-ing snippets from my diary, I hope to elevate a writing practice that normally isn't so remarkable or publicly-presentable."

Images are cropped into squares and re-arranged into multi-image grids, forming a visual archive of impulses, interests, and recurring aesthetics. Rather than representing the self directly, identity emerges through processes of selection, repetition, and re-formatting. Conceived as a printed publication, the project is now re-circulated online for this final showcase through a scan of the physical work. This work is still in progress."

It explores low-resolution imagery, the relationship between text and image, and the tension between imagination and originality. For me, it is an experiment in “writing a novel with images” — where colors become narrative fragments, and words transform pixels into stories.\n\nI use AI tools and turned this piece into an interactive game. I invite others to participate and experience this process of generating an “image-novel” together — navigating between coloring and naming, and reconsidering the relationship between image, language, and authorship."

It focuses on landscapes we often encounter not in person, but as desktop wallpapers: vast, awe-inspiring scenes rendered into digital backdrops. Starting as digital files, these landscapes are processed and distorted, then brought back into the physical world and reworked by hand with coloured pencils and embroidery.\n\nThe work reflects on the shifting status of these images of nature as they oscillate between digital and physical forms, questioning how the screen both frames and distances our experience of the sublime."

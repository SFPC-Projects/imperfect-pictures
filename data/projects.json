Since 2022 I've maintained a consistent daily practice of journaling, often being a dumping ground for my ruminations, therapy revelations, feral crashouts, and mundane todo lists. By glitterfy-ing snippets from my diary, I hope to elevate a writing practice that normally isn't so remarkable or publicly-presentable."

Images are cropped into squares and re-arranged into multi-image grids, forming a visual archive of impulses, interests, and recurring aesthetics. Rather than representing the self directly, identity emerges through processes of selection, repetition, and re-formatting. Conceived as a printed publication, the project is now re-circulated online for this final showcase through a scan of the physical work. This work is still in progress."

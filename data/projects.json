Since 2022 I've maintained a consistent daily practice of journaling, often being a dumping ground for my ruminations, therapy revelations, feral crashouts, and mundane todo lists. By glitterfy-ing snippets from my diary, I hope to elevate a writing practice that normally isn't so remarkable or publicly-presentable."
